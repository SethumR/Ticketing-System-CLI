# Real-Time Ticket Simulation System

A robust real-time ticket simulation system built using Java, leveraging multithreading, synchronization, serialization, and file handling. The system provides a dynamic environment to simulate ticket vending and retrieval, based on user-defined parameters, with support for saving configurations and results in `.txt` and `.json` formats.

## üìñ Introduction

This project simulates a ticketing system where vendors and customers interact in real-time. The system:

- Accepts user inputs to define simulation parameters.
- Simulates ticket vending and customer retrieval processes with multithreading for concurrency.
- Manages ticket inventory using synchronization to ensure thread safety.
- Saves simulation data to `.txt` and `.json` files for analysis or reuse.
